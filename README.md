Welcome to my GitHub. I am a third-year computer science student focused on practical, scalable software projects that blend AI, system architecture, and creative applications. My background in both development and operations allows me to build full-stack systems that are robust, efficient, and production-ready.

## Beyond Code

When I am not developing or studying, I am usually outdoorsâ€”exploring the West Coast or considering how technology can support creativity, learning, and positive impact. I enjoy working on projects that are meaningful, technically challenging, and creatively open-ended.
