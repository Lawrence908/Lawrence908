# Hi, I'm Chris 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a third-year computer science student focused on practical, scalable software projects that blend AI, system architecture, and creative applications. My background in both development and operations allows me to build full-stack systems that are robust, efficient, and production-ready.

### 🚀 What I’m Working On

- 🎨 **Magic Pages** – A full-stack Django-based web application that turns user-submitted inputs into fully customized children's storybooks.  
  - **AI-powered storytelling**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT-4-o-mini, a lightweight and high-performance variant of the GPT-4 model, to generate creative stories and imagery tailored to each child.  
  - **Dynamic customization**: Supports user-selected themes, character traits, dedications, and more.  
  - **End-to-end automation**: From story and cover generation to PDF assembly using LibreOffice Headless, then direct submission to Lulu for print-on-demand.  
  - **Modern deployment**: Hosted on Microsoft Azure using VMs, PostgreSQL, Azure Key Vault, and Blob Storage.  
  - **Secure integration**: Authenticated API endpoints connect seamlessly to a WooCommerce-powered WordPress frontend.

This project pulls together AI integration, secure API design, microservice-inspired modularity, and cloud-based infrastructure—all geared toward creating a production-ready personalized publishing system.

### 📚 What I’m Learning

I'm expanding my backend development toolkit with:

- **FastAPI** – Building high-performance, asynchronous APIs for future microservice-based systems.  
- **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Integration** – Exploring smart contracts and Web3 infrastructure.  
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** – Designing scalable, modular systems with independently deployable services.

### 🌍 Beyond Code

When I’m not developing or studying, I’m usually outdoors—exploring the West Coast or thinking about how tech can support creativity, learning, and positive impact. I love working on projects that are meaningful, technically challenging, and creatively open-ended.

Check out my repos and feel free to reach out—I'm always open to collaboration, learning, or sharing ideas.
