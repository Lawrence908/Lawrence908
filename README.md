# Hi, I'm Chris! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a third-year computer science student with a passion for learning and building projects that blend my interests in AI, software development, and making a positive impact on the world.

### 🌟 What I’m Up To
- 🔭 I’m currently working on **AstrID** – an astronomy ML classification program. It’s an exciting project where I’m using data from space telescopes to classify celestial objects, and I’m diving deep into AI techniques to push the boundaries of this field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **OS processes, multithreading, and concurrency** with C. Exploring how the underlying systems work has been a fascinating journey and enriching my understanding of low-level computing.

### 💻 Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, Bash
- **Tools**: VSCode, GitHub, Shopify
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Django
- **Interests**: AI/ML, data science, software development

### 🌍 Beyond Code
When I’m not coding or studying, I’m probably thinking about how to use technology to make the world a better place or enjoying the outdoors. Whether it's helping companies build more efficient systems or working on personal projects that push boundaries, I’m always excited to explore new challenges!

Feel free to check out my repositories and projects – I’m always open to feedback and collaboration!

*Let’s build something amazing together!*
