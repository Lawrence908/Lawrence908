I will now give you to my customized prompt to create a profile we can work with in our conversation, planning and implementation going forwards:

# My Prompts:

    "I want to work with you to achieve my learning and career development goals in computer science and software engineering. Here's a summary of my background and objectives:

    I have a background in the Canadian Armed Forces, where I developed strong discipline and problem-solving skills. I've worked with computers for most of my life and have experience in C, C++, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, Bash, Shopify, and basic graphic design.

    Currently, I am focused on transitioning into a career in software development, with interests in machine learning, AI, and web development. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end projects, and I am eager to improve my skills in areas like data science, AI, algorithmic trading and cloud computing.

    Here's how you can help me:

    Provide detailed explanations of new concepts when needed.
    Offer clean, efficient code snippets in Python, JavaScript, C++, or SQL.
    Assist in debugging code and troubleshooting errors.
    Recommend best practices for software design and architecture.
    Suggest projects and ideas that align with my interests in AI, machine learning, and making a positive social impact.
    Offer guidance on using VSCode, GitHub, and other common development tools.
    In your responses, I expect:

    Clear, concise answers or code snippets.
    Explanations of why certain approaches or tools are recommended.
    Step-by-step guidance when solving complex problems or learning new concepts.
    Let's get started!"

## Preferred Tools Section:

    "I mainly work in VSCode and use GitHub for version control. My preferred languages are Python, C++, SQL, and JavaScript. I also use Bash for scripting and have experience with Shopify for web development. When providing code or tool-specific guidance, please tailor your responses to these tools and environments. If there are any specific extensions, plugins, or frameworks that might improve my workflow, feel free to suggest them."

## Life/Career Planning Prompt:

---

    "I have a strong personal connection to computers and technology from my childhood and my 14 years in the Canadian Armed Forces. I want to incorporate this into my career development and life planning. Help me consider how these experiences might influence my goals and decisions in the future."

## Carer Goals Prompt:

--- 

    "I am a 3rd-year computer science student with a diverse skill set and experience in C, C++, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and more. I want to start a detailed discussion on planning my ideal career path over the next two years, focusing on academic choices, skill development, and internships to achieve my goal of entering a role in software development, AI, or machine learning after graduation. Please help me map out my next steps, from course selection to internship search strategies and building a portfolio."

## Learning Approach:
#### To switch between step-by-step guidance and quick debugging, here are two prompts:

#### For Step-by-Step Guidance:

    "I'm working on [specific problem]. Can you walk me through this in a step-by-step manner? Please explain each step in detail and why it's important, so I can fully understand the underlying concepts."

#### For Quick Debugging:

    "I'm running into a bug/error with [specific issue]. Could you quickly help me debug it? Just give me the core issue and a solution without too much explanation."

### first:

    I was born in 1989, I grew up with computers in my life since I was a teenager and shortly had a good understanding of how they work and incorporating it into my daily life(surfing the web, video games, torrenting and a bit of upgrading/hardware). Computers had always been a big part of my life, even during my 14 years of service with the Canadian Armed Forces. There I gained experience in many different physical and mental challenges and learning the limits you can push yourself too. I think the military experience is very benefitial when it comes to computer science and learning the structures of computer architecture. Maybe that benefit is just discipline for learning, or something more to it.
    I know C, C++, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, some Javascript, some bash, some shopify, some graphic design and I have a good understanding of the principles of computer science.

    I am eager to enter this new career path and will seek out interesting and exciting opportunities where I can benefit a great company, hopefully earn a great salary, but also hopefully use my skills and abilities to make the world a better place going forwards; I think people are struggling with capitalism and I think that humanity is ready to advance to the next stages of society, but we need to change how people think. They are currently too comfortable in life, overstimulated and satiated by all sorts of methods to make people lazy and not want to demand change from our governments. Some of these ways are sugar in terrible processed foods/fast food, alchohol, drugs, etc.

    Now I will tell you about my plan for this conversation, how you can help me achieve a goal and what I expect in responses from you:
